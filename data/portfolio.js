    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>NG Transport approached DG Visual Media several years back looking for a fresh look for the their vehicle livery.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>They had a logo which had been created by a friend many years ago when the company was starting out. This had served a purpose to get them going but wasn’t serving to provide the visual identity that reflects their professional service.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>Although the logo needed updating, a decision was made to adopt elements of the original logo which had become recognisable as the mark of an established & trusted service.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>Once their logo was brought up to date, NG Transport were happy to trust us with their new fleet livery & the company branding began to reflect their professional service.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>DG Visual Media has gone on to re-design NG Transports website, design, manufacture & install warehouse & office signage & displays. We also continue to provide livery for their ever-growing fleet.</p>
