        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>NG Transport first approached DG Visual Media several years ago in search of a modern, professional vehicle livery design that would better represent their growing business.</p>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>At the time, the company was using a logo originally created by a friend during its early days. While it had served its purpose in the beginning, the design no longer reflected the quality and professionalism of NG Transport’s services.</p>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>Rather than starting from scratch, we chose to retain key elements of the original logo to maintain the visual recognition it had built over the years. This strategic logo redesign allowed NG Transport to preserve its brand identity while presenting a more refined and professional image.</p>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>With their updated logo in place, NG Transport entrusted DG Visual Media to develop and apply new fleet vehicle livery across their expanding range of commercial vehicles. The updated branding now accurately reflects the high standards and reliability the company is known for.</p>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>Following the success of the fleet branding, we continued to support NG Transport with a full website redesign, and the design, manufacture, and installation of custom warehouse and office signage. Our team remains proud to deliver high-quality graphics and vehicle livery for their continually growing fleet.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Trilogy Freight: A Seamless Brand Built from the Ground Up</h2>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>In 2015, three established haulage companies merged to form Trilogy Freight, marking the beginning of a new chapter in the transport and logistics sector. DG was brought on board to lead the branding process, starting with a fresh, meaningful logo design that would reflect the company’s unified identity.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>The result was a clean, circular arrow icon formed from three colours—each representing one of the founding companies. The smooth transitions between colours symbolise the effortless, reliable freight service Trilogy aims to provide.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>As a creative studio offering logo design in Manchester, DG continued to work alongside Trilogy to develop a strong and consistent visual identity. This included producing easy-to-understand infographics that break down complex freight tariff data, as well as transforming their office interiors into branded, engaging workspaces.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>From initial concept to long-term brand evolution, the partnership between DG and Trilogy Freight shows the lasting impact of thoughtful design and strategic visual storytelling.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Rebranding Town & Country Carpets — From Local Shopfront to Regional Presence</h2>
    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Background</h3>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>In 2022, Paul, the owner of Town & Country Carpets, approached DG Visual Media with a straightforward request: to update the external signage at their first shop in Sale, Greater Manchester.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>At the time, the business was well-regarded locally, but visually, the brand felt dated and inconsistent — lacking a cohesive identity that reflected the premium quality of its products and service. The existing brand featured plain serif typography, no dedicated logo, and limited recognition beyond the immediate area.</p>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>Shortly after that initial project, T&C began to expand rapidly, opening additional locations across Wilmslow, Hale, and surrounding parts of Manchester. As their reputation for luxury flooring supply and expert installation grew, it became clear that the brand identity needed to evolve to match their success and ambitions.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Challenge</h3>
    <p class='sec-text mt-30'>Paul returned to DG Visual Media with a clear and timely brief: “We’ve grown quickly — now the brand needs to catch up.”</p>
     <p class='sec-text mt-30 mb-3'>Our task was to:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Modernise the brand while retaining the trust built since 1999</li>
     <li>Create a professional, premium identity for use across shops, vehicles, and digital platforms</li>
     <li>Ensure consistency and recognisability across an expanding number of locations</li>
     <li>Reflect the company’s growing reputation for high-end flooring solutions</li>
     </ul>
      <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Strategy</h3>
     <p class='sec-text mt-30 mb-3'> Our approach focused on elevating the brand while preserving its local heritage. Key strategic decisions included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name Expansion</b>: Updating from “Carpets” to “Carpets & Floors” to reflect a wider product offering</li>
     <li><b>Logo Development</b>: Creating a T&C monogram as a strong, versatile visual shorthand</li>
      <li><b>Typography & Colour</b>: Introducing refined, trustworthy typefaces and a soft grey-blue palette to signal quality and approachability</li>
      <li><b>Geographical Anchoring</b>: Featuring the shop locations (Wilmslow – Hale – Sale) as a mark of trusted local presence</li>
      <li><b>Legacy Messaging</b>: Including “Est. 1999” to reinforce longevity and experience</li>
    </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Execution</h3>
        <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Logo & Identity</h4>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>We designed a clean, circular emblem featuring “T&C” at its centre — a modern take on a traditional monogram. Supporting text ("Town & Country", "Carpets & Floors") wrapped around the mark, creating a seal-like design suitable for signage, livery, and social media use.</p>
        <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Signage</h4>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>We produced and installed new external signage across all shops. Materials, layout and visual styling were standardised to ensure brand consistency across every location.</p>
        <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Vehicle Livery</h4>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>DG Visual Media also branded T&C’s expanding fleet of vans — giving the business a strong presence on the road and reinforcing recognition across Greater Manchester.</p>


        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Results</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Cohesive Identity</b>: T&C now presents a unified, professional image across shops, vehicles, and online platforms</li>
        <li><b>Improved Perception</b>: The rebrand elevated customer perception and aligned the visual identity with the premium quality of the service</li>
        <li><b>Regional Recognition</b>: The “T&C” logo has become a recognisable symbol across Greater Manchester</li>
        <li><b>Internal Buy-in</b>: Staff and installers feel greater pride representing a polished, professional brand</li>
        </ul>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>“DG Visual Media nailed it — our brand finally reflects the quality of what we do.” — Paul, Owner, Town & Country Carpets</p>

        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>What began as a single signage project for a local shop quickly evolved into a full-scale brand transformation. DG Visual Media worked closely with Town & Country Carpets during a pivotal period of expansion, delivering a refined identity that honours the past while confidently embracing the future.</p>
        <p class='sec-text mt-30'>With a clear, consistent, and elegant brand now in place, T&C is well-positioned to continue growing as one of Greater Manchester’s leading names in luxury flooring.</p>
